It blew so hard and rained so heavily that he could scarcely keep his eyes open, and before he was aware of it he had got quite out of the track, and could neither find road nor path. But he went on, and at last he saw a light far away in the wood. Then he thought he must try and get to it, and after a long, long time he did reach it. There was a large house, and the fire was burning so brightly inside that he could tell that the people were not in bed. So he went in, and inside there was an old woman who was busy about some work.</p><p>‘Good evening, mother!’ said the youth.</p><p>‘Good evening!’ said the old woman.</p><p>‘Hutetu! it is terrible weather outside to-night,’ said the young fellow.</p><p>‘Indeed it is,’ said the old woman.</p></div> </div>
