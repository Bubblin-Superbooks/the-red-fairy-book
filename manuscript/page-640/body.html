Why didn’t you leave the flowers alone? They were your twelve brothers. Now they are changed for ever into ravens.’</p><p>The girl asked, sobbing: ‘Is there no means of setting them free?’</p><p>‘No,’ said the old woman, ‘there is only one way in the whole world, and that is so difficult that you won’t free them by it, for you would have to be dumb and not laugh for seven years, and if you spoke a single word, though but an hour were wanting to the time, your silence would all have been in vain, and that one word would slay your brothers.’</p></div> </div>
