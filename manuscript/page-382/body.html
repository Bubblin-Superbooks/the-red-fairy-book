Thinking he might belong to the household of the Duchess, she said:</p><p>‘How long have you been one of the King’s pages?’</p><p>‘I am not in the service of the King, madam,’ answered he, ‘but in yours.’</p><p>‘In mine?’ said the Princess with great surprise. ‘Then how is it that I have never seen you before?’</p><p>‘Ah, Princess!’ said he, ‘I have never before dared to present myself to you, but now the King’s marriage threatens you with so many dangers that I have resolved to tell you at once how much I love you already, and I trust that in time I may win your regard.
