After a long, long time he came to a small hut at the foot of a rock, outside which an old woman was standing drawing water up from a well with her nose, it was so long.</p><p>‘Good-evening, mother,’ said the man.</p><p>‘Good-evening to you too,’ said the old woman. ‘No one has called me mother this hundred years.’</p><p>‘Can I lodge here to-night?’ said the man.</p><p>‘No,’ said the old woman. But the man took out his roll of tobacco, lighted a little of it, and then gave her a whiff. Then she was so delighted that she began to dance, and thus the man got leave to stay the night there. It was not long before he asked about Farmer Weatherbeard.</p></div> </div>
