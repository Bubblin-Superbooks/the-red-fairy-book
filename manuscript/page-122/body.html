Remember not the past; much better fly with me while Koshchei the Deathless is out of sight. Perhaps he won’t catch us.’</p><p>So they got ready and fled. Now Koshchei was out hunting. Towards evening he was returning home, when his good steed stumbled beneath him.</p><p>‘Why stumblest thou, sorry jade? Scentest thou some ill?’ The steed replied:</p><p>‘Prince Ivan has come and carried off Marya Morevna.’ ‘Is it possible to catch them?’</p><p>‘It is possible to sow wheat, to wait till it grows up, to reap it and thresh it, to grind it to flour, to make five pies of it, to eat those pies, and then to start in pursuit—and even then to be in time.’ Koshchei galloped off and caught up Prince Ivan.</p></div> </div>
