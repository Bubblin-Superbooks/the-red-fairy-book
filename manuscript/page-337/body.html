<p>‘You stupid old Giant,’ said his wife, ‘you only smell a nice sheep, which I have grilled for your dinner.’</p></blockquote><p>And the Giant sat down, and his wife brought up a whole sheep for his dinner. When he had eaten it all up, he said:</p><p>‘Now bring me my harp, and I will have a little music while you take your walk.’</p><p>The Giantess obeyed, and returned with a beautiful harp. The framework was all sparkling with diamonds and rubies, and the strings were all of gold.</p></div> </div>
