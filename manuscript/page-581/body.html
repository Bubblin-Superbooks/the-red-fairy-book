But the youth went down into the stable and asked Dapplegrim what she had done with herself.</p><p>‘Oh, all that you have to do is to take your gun, and go down to the water and aim at the duck which is swimming about there, and she will soon discover herself,’ said Dapplegrim.</p><p>The youth snatched up his gun and ran to the lake. ‘I will just have a shot at that duck,’ said he, and began to aim at it.</p><p>‘Oh, no, dear friend, don’t shoot! It is I,’ said the Princess. So he had found her once.</p><p>The second time the Princess changed herself into a loaf, and laid herself on the table among four other loaves; and she was so like the other loaves that no one could see any difference between them.</p></div> </div>
