When he got up there and found them, each mare had her foal, and by the side of one of them was a big dapple-grey foal as well, which was so sleek that it shone again.</p><p>‘Well, my little foal, you are a fine fellow!’ said the youth.</p><p>‘Yes, but if you will kill all the other little foals so that I can suck all the mares for a year, you shall see how big and handsome I shall be then!’ said the Foal.</p><p>So the youth did this—he killed all the twelve foals, and then went back again.</p><p>Next year, when he came home again to look after his mares and the foal, it was as fat as it could be, and its coat shone with brightness, and it was so big that the lad had the greatest difficulty in getting on its back, and each of the mares had another foal.</p></div> </div>
