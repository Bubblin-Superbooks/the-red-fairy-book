It was not at all easy to fill the milk-can, which was large and round. It would not go down into the well, and the gypsy had to try again and again.</p><p>At last her arms grew so tired that when she did manage to get the can properly under the water she had no strength to pull it up, and it rolled to the bottom.</p><p>On seeing the can disappear, she made such a miserable face that Zizi, who had been watching her all this time, burst into fits of laughter.</p></div> </div>
